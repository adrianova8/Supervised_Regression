# S10 T02: Supervised Regression

**Target:*
* Regression models
* Regression trees
* Random Forest
* Neural Networks
* Other models

_Let's practice and become familiar with regressions_

# LEVEL 1

 ## Exercise 1
  - Create at least three different regression models to try to reduce DelayedFlights.csv's flight delay (ArrDelay) as much as possible.
 
 ## Exercise 2
  - Compare them based on MSE and R2.

 ## Exercise 3
 - Train them using the different parameters they support.

 ## Exercise 4
 - Compare your performance using the traint / test approach or using all data (internal validation).

 # LEVEL 2
 
 ## Exercise 5
 - Perform some variable engineering process to improve prediction.
  
# LEVEL 3

## Exercise 6
 - Do not use the DepDelay variable when making predictions.
